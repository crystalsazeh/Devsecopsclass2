A Tuple
A tuple in Python is similar to a list. The difference between the two is that we cannot change the elements of a tuple once it is assigned whereas we can change the elements of a list.

A Type
type()	Returns the type of an object
type() method returns class type of the argument(object) passed as parameter. type() function is mostly used for debugging purposes.

Two different types of arguments can be passed to type() function, single and three argument. If single argument type(obj) is passed, it returns the type of given object. If three arguments type(name, bases, dict) is passed, it returns a new type object.


Vars 
vars()	Returns the __dict__ property of an object
